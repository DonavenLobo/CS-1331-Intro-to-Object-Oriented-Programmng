//I worked on this homework assignment alone, using only course materials

Bad1 - Error occurs at compile time. The class name 'BAD1' is all caps when it should be 'Bad1' since the name of the
java file is Bad1.java

Bad2 - Error occurs at run-time. The program tries to divide by 0 which is impossible, hence we get an error at
run-time. To fix it I just switched b and a in the formula so that 0 is in the numerator.

Bad3 - Error occurs at compile time. The program incorrectly assigns the String method type to an input that is of
primitive type char. To fix this, we can change the single quotes to double quotes to state that the input is a string.
