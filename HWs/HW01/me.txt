Hi I'm Donaven, I go by Donny though. I am a ME major, and I am doing this class to apply for a CS minor during the fall.
I just finished my first year at Georgia Tech which unfortunately got cut short due to COVID. I enjoy spending time with
friends and family, however at this time I have really been gaming a lot since there isn't much else to do.
